# Captcha Generator App ![Green Robot](/images/favicon-32x32.png)

This is a simple web application based on my own design that generates and verifies captchas using vanilla JavaScript.

### Overview

The Captcha Generator App is designed to provide a basic example of how captchas can be generated and verified using JavaScript. Captchas are used to distinguish between human users and bots, and they often involve tasks that are easy for humans but difficult for automated scripts.

This app allows users to generate a random captcha text, and then they need to type the exact text into an input field to verify their humanity. The app compares the entered text with the generated captcha and displays an alert indicating whether the entered captcha is correct or not.
